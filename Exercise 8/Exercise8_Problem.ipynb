The setup will be simple Tic-Tac-Toe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), and the objective of this notebook will be to create a Human vs Computer game with the Computer Player employing an AI strategy for gameplay. Some of the code is provided, while you may have filled in some on your own. Give it a shot, and have fun!        \n",
