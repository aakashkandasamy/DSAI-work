The setup is a maze with the problem of finding an escape path from the *start* position to the *goal* position on a two-dimensional grid. You will learn how to map a maze (two-dimensional grid) to a graph, and then apply the search algorithms on the graph to solve the problem. Some of the code is provided, while you may have filled in some on your own.
